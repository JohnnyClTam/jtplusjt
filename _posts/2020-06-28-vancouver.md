# Vancouver

Vancouver is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).

## Breakfast

Often, an overlooked meal by Vancouverites, not many restaurants are open for the early birds.

### Siegels Bagels

Siegel's is Vancouver's oldest bagel joint which also happens to be open 24-hours.

<p style="color:#8b9a71"> <b>Johnny:</b> The Energy bagel is my favourite. Though there's this one time they ran out at 11:00 PM and I commented "Are you out of Energy?". All I got was a blank stare.</p> 

### Marulilu Cafe

A hole in the wall Japanese cafe situated directly across Broadway-City Hall station. With a wide selection of tea, coffee and meal options all reasonably priced, the only challenge becomes parking.

<p style="color:#8b9a71"> <b>Johnny:</b> The Breakfast Plate A is a perfect choice. They are generous with their portions and serve 2 eggs, 2 toast, 2 hashbrowns, 2 tomatoes and a meat option.</p> 


## Brunch

A weekend tradition, Vancouver has an abundant brunch scene. Avocado toasts, eggs benedict and fruit bowls can be found everywhere.

### Jam Cafe

Jam Cafe, one of our favourite brunch restaurants, serves contemporary Canadian food. This place takes no reservations so come early and be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.

<p style="color:#8b9a71"> <b>Johnny:</b> Try their eggs benedict for a tangy twist on the classic dish with their pineapple hollandaise sauce.</p>

Linh Cafe is one of Kitsilano's gems, serving a combination of traditional French and modern Vietnamese cooking.

<p style="color:#8b9a71"> <b>Johnny:</b> Poutine Breakfast with Vietnamese Coffee is my favourite. It's a ham frites with egg and a hearty breakfast. </p>

### Site Variables

To change site build settings, edit the `_config.yml` file found in the root of your repository, which you can tweak however you like. More information on configuration settings and plugins can be found on [the Jekyll documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/). This is also where you will be able to customize the title, description, and the author/owner of your site.

If you are hosting your site on GitHub Pages, then committing a change to the `_config.yml` file will force a rebuild of your site with Jekyll. Any changes made should be viewable soon after. If you are hosting your site locally, then you must run `jekyll serve` again for the changes to take place.

In the `settings.yml` file found in the `_data` folder, you will be able to customize your site settings, such as setting Disqus comments, Google Analytics, what shows up in your menu, and social media information.
